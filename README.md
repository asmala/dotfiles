My shell config focused on Rails and Clojure development with
[Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) as the main color
scheme of choice.

Currently includes configuration for:

* [Zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) (using
  [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/))
* [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) (using
  [Janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus/))
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
